This is a project to create a simple copy of the Airbnb website, the project will cover some of the aibnb website features but not all.A command interpreter will be used as the frontend to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)The Cmd class provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters.There is no good reason to instantiate Cmd itself; rather, it’s useful as a superclass of an interpreter class you define yourself in order to inherit Cmd’s methods and encapsulate action methods.eg class Example(cmd.Cmd):, but you have to import the cmd module first
